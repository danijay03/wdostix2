            <p>The sea turtle conservancy's hatchery project is among its most crucial operations. Before being released into the water, the project's sanctuary allows for the safe hatching of saved and gathered eggs. A specific number of each hatching is also held back for a little time for "headstarting" before release.The goal of the hatchery program is to increase the proportion of hatchlings that make it to the ocean and endure the perilous first few months of life.

        <p class="fade-in">From each batch of hatchlings, only a select few will ever reach adulthood. Each and every nesting site, egg, hatchling, and turtle is hence essential to the survival of the species. Sea turtles are unfortunately in danger frequently.<br>Fundraising and grants are essential to the project's operation.</p></div><br><br>
        <div class="p2">The project's work is supported through donations and grants. Each year, the effort contributes to the upkeep and clearing of the local beach, protects crucial nesting areas (especially critical in light of the Tsunami's devastation), and releases thousands of hatchlings. You can start to comprehend the project's significance when you realize how long it has been ongoing!</div>
