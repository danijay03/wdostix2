            <p>Sea turtles journey between land and sea and swim thousands of ocean miles during their long lifetimes. They wait decades until they can reproduce, returning to the same beaches where they were born to lay their eggs. Females can lay hundreds of eggs in one nesting season, yet few will yield hatchlings that survive their first year of life. Beyond these significant natural challenges, sea turtles face multiple threats caused by humans, such as bycatch in commercial fishing gear, illegal trade, consumption, and climate change.</p>
        </div><br><br>
        <h2>OVERHARVESTING AND ILEGAL TRADE</h2>
        <div class="p1">Continued unsustainable harvesting of sea turtles for human food and the trading of their components is taking place. Many people all around the world rely on turtle eggs and meat as a food supply and source of income. Some people also slaughter turtles for use in religious rituals and as medicine. This method results in the yearly loss of tens of thousands of sea turtles, decimating populations of the already endangered green and hawksbill sea turtles.<br>
            Additionally, turtles are still being killed for both domestic and foreign markets. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), a global accord among nations to control or prohibit international trade in threatened species, forbids the international trade in all species of sea turtles and any of their parts. Nevertheless, illegal trafficking continues.</div>

        <br>
        <h2>POLLUTION</h2>
        <div class="p1">When sea turtles try to eat floating plastic objects, they may mistake them for jellyfish and suffocate as a result. These interactions frequently end in death. Ghost gear, lost or abandoned fishing equipment, entangles sea turtles and can cause them to drown or become incapable of feeding or swimming. Hatchlings can become trapped in trash on beaches, preventing them from swimming to the ocean. Sea turtles of various ages are also harmed by oil spills.</div>

        <br>
        <h2>HABITAT LOSS</h2>
        <div class="p1">Beaches are necessary for sea turtles to lay their eggs. Sea turtle breeding beaches have been destroyed or interfered with as a direct result of unchecked coastal expansion, beach traffic, and other human activities worldwide. To give two examples, vehicle traffic on beaches compacts the sand, making it difficult for female turtles to dig nests, while lights from roads and buildings disorient hatchlings away from the water. Coral reefs and seagrass beds, which are used as turtle feeding grounds, are harmed and destroyed by activities occurring on land, such as sedimentation from logging and nutrient runoff from agriculture. The dredging and sand filling methods used in beach restoration operations to preserve seaside buildings have also been proved to be detrimental.</div>

        <br>
        <h2>CLIMATE CHANGE</h2>
        <div class="p1">Even the sex of offspring is impacted by environmental factors like temperature at all phases of a sea turtle's existence. Fewer male hatchlings are emerging as a result of unusually warm temperatures brought on by climate change.<br>
            Increasingly severe storms and sea level rise can destroy crucial breeding beaches and harm nests, while warmer sea surface temperatures can also result in the loss of major sea turtle grazing grounds.</div>
