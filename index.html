        <div class="h1"><b>WHAT ARE TURTLES?</b></div>
        <div class="p1" >The class of reptiles that includes turtles, tortoises, and terrapins is known as the testudines. This group of reptiles is the oldest, predating snakes, crocodiles, and even alligators.Turtles date back more than 200 million years to the dinosaur era, which preceded the emergence of humans.They can be identified by their bone cartilaginous shell, a very protective covering that shields them from predatory animals and other species.To increase protection, they might tuck their heads.

                    <p>A turtles shell is actually part of its skeleton.It's made up of over 50 bones which include the turtle's rib cage and spine.because of this a turtle's shell can grow with them as they age adn therefore their shells are never too "big" for them.Turtles like humans can be carnivores(meat eaters), herbivores(plant eaters) or omnivores(both plant and meat eaters);quite a few baby turtle(otherwise known as turtle hatchlings) start their lives as carnivores and grow upto be herbivores or omnivores as they age.Turtles are 'amniotes' they breathe air and lay their eggs on land, although many species live in or around water.These cold-blooded creatures have an incredibly long life span.The Tonga Islander Tu"i Malila, who was the oldest person ever recorded, died at the ripe old age of 188.Sadly, many turtle species are in danger of extinction! According to the IUCN, 129 of the 300 turtle and tortoise species that are currently found on Earth are either vulnerable, endangered, or severely endangered. Threats to the environment include habitat loss, pollution, poaching, and the illegal pet trade.</p>

            <div class="p3">
                Even though we mostly observe turtles relaxing and enjoying life, they play a significant role in the environment. they moved between habitats and traveled the world while digging.
            <br><br>two of those eco systems being:<br>
            <div class="unorder">
                <ul>
                <li>Oceans</li>
                <li>beaches</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="p3">The kind of animals that do the most good in the world and the least, if any, bad are turtles. Some turtles even offer shelter to other animals, such as burrowing owls, rabbits, and bobcats, as they are scavengers that clean up dead fish from lakes and rivers. Turtles can even be thought of as bio-engineers since they spread seeds over the landscape, which keeps it healthy and diverse. They also rotate the sand on the ocean floor, which redistributes energy from one eco-system to another.

        <div class="h1"><b>HOW CAN YOU TELL THE DIFFRENCE BETWEEN TURTLES AND TORTISES?</b></div>
           <div class="p3">While turtles can live in the water their whole lives, live on land their entire lives, or be semi-aquatic and live on both land and water, testudines are land-only creatures that cannot swim.
